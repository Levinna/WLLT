## 0.2 PCA / Eigenvectors
Beginner's Guide to Eigenvector / PCA : https://wiki.pathmind.com/eigenvector

Eigen : 고유의, Meaning "very own" in Germen (e.g. : mein eigenes Auto : "my very own car")

Linear Transformations : with matrix operations, we can easily change one vector into another vector with multiplying and adding them.

Eigenvector : changes length but not directon
 => already pointing in the same direction that the matrix is pushing all vectors toward.
<br>In formal definition : a vector that responds to a matrix as though that matrix were a scalar coefficient.
