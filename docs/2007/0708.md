## Learning Objectives
```
1) Define interests and relationships that may result in a conflict of interest.
2) Distinguish different types of COIs in research.
3) Identify federal regulations that govern disclosure and management of individual conflicts of interest.
4) Discuss challenges and strategies to manage individual and institutional COIs (ICOIs) in research.
5) Recognize the ethical concerns associated with COIs in research.

### COI가 영향을 줄 수 있는 연구활동
다음과 같은 상황에서 발생할 수 있다.
```
    Decisions about enrollment and inclusion/exclusion criteria
    Decisions about the choice of personnel to conduct the study
    Recruitment and consenting of research subjects
    Vendor selection in the purchase of equipment and other supplies
    Data collection, analysis, and interpretation
    Sharing of research results
    Choice of research design and statistical methods
```

### Type of COIs
COI - Individual - Financial / Non-Financial
COI - Institutional - Financial / Non-Financial

### COI Committees and Management Plans
1) Review Potential COIs
2) Develop Management Plan
3) Minimize Risk of Bias

### Management Plan Examples
```
    Adding an independent monitor to the study team to make sure that the research procedures are transparent
    Creating a safe environment for any research team member and/or student to report any perceived conflicts that may occur while the study is being conducted
    Disclosing the potential COI to the subjects in the informed consent form
    Reducing the researcher’s role in the research if they have a COI (less interaction with subjects, less data analysis)
    Using an independent third-party review of data
    Ensuring a careful study design, which may include randomization and blinding
    Disclosure of the COI, including in publications or presentations of the study results
    Requiring an independent monitor to ensure that student progress is not affected by the conflicted mentor’s activities (for example, doing work for the mentor’s start-up company at the expense of doing work for a graduate or doctoral thesis)
