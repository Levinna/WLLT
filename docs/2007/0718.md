#### Advice From Hinton
```
* Advice 1 : Read the literature but don't read too much of it.
* Advice 2 : Never stop programming
* Advice 3 : Read enough so you can start developing intuitions and then trust your intuitions and go for it.
* Advice 4 : See if you can find an advisor who has beliefs similar to yours. 

1.
Read a little bit of the litarature and notice something that you think everybody is doing wrong.
I'm contrarying in that sense.
You look at it and it just doesn't feel right and then figure out how to do it right.
And then when people tell you, that's no good, just keep at it.

Good principle for helping people keep at it.
>> Either your intuitions are good or not, If your intuitions are good, you should follow them and you'll eventually be successful.
If your intuitions are not good, it doesn't matter what you do.
