Research(연구) : "A systematic investigation, including research development, testing, and evaluation, designed to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge" (Protection of Human Subjects 2018).
단 다음은 예외로 한다.
- 학술적이고 서술적인 활동인경우
- 공공보건 목적의 감시 활동인경우
- 법에 의해 보장된 사법부의 정보, 생체표본(검체), 기록에 대한 수집 및 분석 또는 범죄수사의 목적인 경우
- 정보부, 국가안전국, 국방부, 기타 국가안전 관련 기관에 의해 승인된 활동인 경우
(계획하고 있는 활동이 연구에 해당하는지 명확하지 않은 경우 연구자는 반드시 해당 기관에 설치된 IRB에 문의한다.)
Human Subject(피험자) : "A living individual about whom an investigator (whether professional or student) conducting research:
    1. Obtains information or biospecimens through intervention or interaction with the individual, and uses, studies, or analyzes the information or biospecimens; or
    2. Obtains, uses, studies, analyzes, or generates identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens (Protection of Human Subjects 2018). "
(몇 주법은 사망한 사람이나 태아의 경우에도 피험자를 포함하는 경우가 있다. 연구가 수행될 지역의 IRB를 통해 해당 주에서 정의하고 있는 피험자에 대해 확인하는 것이 필요하다.)
Private Information(사적인 정보/개인정보) : “Private information includes information about behavior that occurs in a context in which the individual can reasonably expect that no observation or recording is taking place, and information that has been provided for specific purposes by the individual and that the individual can reasonably expect that it will not be made public (such as, a medical record)” (Protection of Human Subjects 2018).
Identifiable Private Information(신원을 파악할 수 있는 개인정보) : “Identifiable private information is private information for which the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the information” (Protection of Human Subjects 2018).
Identifiable Biospecimens(신원을 파악할 수 있는 생체표본) : “An identifiable biospecimen is a biospecimen for which the identity of the subject is or may readily be ascertained by the investigator or associated with the biospecimen” (Protection of Human Subjects 2018).
Coded Private Information or Biological Specimens(암호화된 개인정보 또는 생물학적 표본) : The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP 2008) guidance considers private information or specimens to be individually identifiable when they can be linked to specific individuals directly or indirectly through coding systems. OHRP guidance recommends that only a knowledgeable person or entity be authorized to determine if use of coded specimen or data constitute research. OHRP recommends that researchers not be given authority to make an independent determination that research involving coded private information or specimens does not involve human subjects.
Clinical Investigation : "Any experiment that involves a test article and one or more human subjects and that either must meet the requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration...or need not meet the requirements for prior submission to the Food and Drug Administration...but the results of which are intended to be later submitted to, or held for inspection by, the Food and Drug Administration as part of an application for a research or marketing permit" (Institutional Review Boards 2015). 
Clinical Trial : “A research study in which one or more human subjects are prospectively assigned to one or more interventions (which may include placebo or other control) to evaluate the effects of the interventions on biomedical or behavioral health-related outcomes” (Protection of Human Subjects 2018).

### 1-9-2a. Research Categories that Qualify for Expedited Review
HHS의 간사에 의해 결정된다.

공통규칙에 따르면 HHS의 간사는 8년마다 신속심의가 가능한 연구 카테고리를 평가하고 수정한다.
Expedited categories 1 through 7 pertain to both the initial and continuing IRB review. Categories 8 and 9 pertain only to continuing review.

연방규정은 2가지 주 기준을 두고 있다.
1. The research may not involve more than minimal risk.
2. The entire research project must be consistent with one or more of the federally defined categories (OHRP 2003).

* Minimal Risk : the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests

1. Category 1 : Clinical studies on drugs or medical devices for which an investigational new drug (IND) application or investigational device exemption (IDE) is not required. Similarly, a study with a cleared/approved medical device that is being used in accordance with its cleared/approved labeling.
2. Category 2 : Collection of blood samples by finger stick, heel stick, ear stick, or venipuncture.
3. Category 3 : Prospective collection of biological specimens for research purposes by noninvasive means.
4. Category 4 : Collection of data through noninvasive procedures routinely employed in clinical practice provided that
1) The noninvasive procedure must not involve general anesthesia or sedation routinely employed in clinical practice or procedures involving x-rays or microwaves.
2) Where medical devices are employed, they must be cleared/approved for marketing. (Studies intended to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the medical device are not generally eligible for expedited review, including studies of cleared medical devices for new indications.)
5. Category 5 : Research involving data, documents, records, or specimens that
1) Have been collected; or
2) Will be collected solely for non-research purposes (such as, for medical treatment or diagnosis).
6. Category 6 : Collection of data from voice, video, digital, or image recordings made for research purposes
7. Category 7 : Research on individual or group characteristics or behavior
8. Category 8 : Continuing review of research previously approved by the full/convened IRB where
1) The research is permanently closed to the enrollment of new subjects; all subjects have completed all research-related interventions; and, the research remains active only for long-term follow-up of subjects;
2) No subjects have been enrolled and no additional risks have been identified; or
3) The remaining research activities are limited to data analysis.
9. Category 9 : Continuing review of research not conducted under an IND application or IDE, and where categories 2 through 8 do not apply, but the IRB has determined and documented at a full/convened meeting that the research involves no greater than minimal risk and no additional risks have been identified.

위 카테고리와 미 연방규정(45 CFR 46.111 and 21 CFR 56.111)을 준수한 경우에만 승인 가능하다.

# 2. Data Signal Processing
based on Coursera DSP 1 Course by EPFL : Digital signals and Fourier transforms

## 2-1. What is digital signal processing?

## Signal
Description of the evolution of a physical phenomenon
weather -> temperature
sound -> pressure | magnetic deviation
light intensity -> gray level on paper

### Processing
Analysis : understanding the information carried by the signal
Synthesis : creating a signal to contain the given information

### The Digital Paradigm
Key ingredients
1) Discrete Time
2) Discrete Amplitude

Discretizing time

### What is time?
Augustine of Hippo, Confessions : Time is not exists
Immanuel Kant : Spiritual Things
Zeno of Elea : The Dichotomy Paradox

### Bridging the models : the founding fathers
Harry Nyquist and Claude Shannon에 의해 Continuous Time을 Discrete Time으로 옮긴다 하더라도 정보가 손실되는 것은 아니라는 것이 증명됐다.

### The Sampling Theorem (1920)

### When can we do all this? Joseph Fourier will tell us.
Fourier Transform!

### Digital amplitude 의 장점 / 중요성
Storage / Processing : 프로세서가 Integer만 다룰 수 있도록 하므로 / Transmission

### Storage
Analog Storage : 종이, 사진, LP판, 테이프 등 (규격 간 호환성이 없다...)
Digital Storage : {0, 1} mapped to countable integers

### Processing
Analog : 어려운 매커니즘 / 기어
Digital : 추상화된 언어로 조작

### Transmission
TX - channel - RX
Analog signal을 전송할 경우 노이즈 또한 Gain 만큼 증폭되므로 문제가 발생 (전송길이가 길수록 어려움..)
Digital signal은 0/1을 전압차로 전송하므로 threshold를 이용해 거의 완벽히 복원 가능함



### 단어장
```
perplexing : 난처하게 하다
hands-on : 직접 해보는
harness : (집학적) 마구, 마구 비슷한 것, 동력화하다
profound :
